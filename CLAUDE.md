# Claude Instructions for Portfolio Website Revamp

## Project Overview

Revamp naufalathallah.github.io into a vibrant, meme CSS-inspired portfolio website with:

- **Rainbow cycling background** that continuously changes colors
- **Dynamic animations** and eye-catching visual effects
- **Professional content** from Naufal's SDET/QA Engineer experience
- **Retro/Y2K aesthetic** mixed with modern web technologies

## Technical Requirements

### Tech Stack

- **Pure HTML5** (single page or minimal multi-page)
- **Vanilla CSS3** with extensive animations
- **Vanilla JavaScript** for interactions and dynamic effects
- **No frameworks** - keep it lightweight for GitHub Pages

### Visual Style Guidelines

- **Background**: Animated rainbow gradient that cycles through colors smoothly
- **Typography**: Mix of retro fonts (think 90s/early 2000s web) with modern readability
- **Colors**: Vibrant, high-contrast palette with neon accents
- **Animations**: Smooth transitions, hover effects, text animations, floating elements
- **Layout**: Creative, non-traditional layouts that still maintain usability
- **Effects**: CSS transforms, gradients, shadows, maybe some matrix/glitch effects

### Animation Ideas

1. **Background**: Smooth rainbow gradient animation (hue rotation)
2. **Text Effects**: Typewriter animations, glitch effects, neon glow
3. **Cards**: Hover transformations, 3D rotations, scale effects

### Interactive Elements

- Animated navigation (if multi-page)
- Hover effects that change background color intensity
- Click animations on contact buttons
- Smooth scrolling between sections
- Maybe a fun easter egg (Konami code?)

### Performance Considerations

- Optimize animations for smooth 60fps
- Use `transform` and `opacity` for hardware acceleration
- Minimize layout thrashing
- Consider `prefers-reduced-motion` for accessibility
- Keep total file size reasonable for fast loading

### Responsive Design

- Mobile-first approach
- Ensure animations work well on touch devices
- Maintain readability across all screen sizes
- Test on various devices and browsers

## Content Tone

- **Professional but playful**: Show serious SDET expertise with fun presentation
- **Achievement-focused**: Highlight measurable impacts (80% reduction, automation percentages)
- **Tech-savvy**: Demonstrate knowledge through design choices and animations
- **Confident**: This is a senior SDET's portfolio - show expertise boldly

## Deployment Notes

- Optimized for GitHub Pages
- Single HTML file or minimal file structure
- All assets should be inline or from CDN
- Test across different browsers and devices

## Inspiration References
